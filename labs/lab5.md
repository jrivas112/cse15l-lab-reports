<h1>Student Post</h1>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>
        I'm having a weird issue with my Java program. I've attached a screenshot below that shows the output I'm
        getting. The program is supposed to calculate the factorial of a given number, but as you can see, the
        result is way off. I've tried different input values, and it always gives me unexpected output.
</p>
<p>
        Here's a snippet of my code:

        I'm not sure what's causing this strange behavior. Any help would be appreciated!

<h1>Response from TA</h1>
<p>Hey there!</p>
<p>
        Thanks for providing the details. It seems like your factorial calculation logic might be correct, but
        let's try to debug this step by step. Try to remember what factorial means. For example if n = 5 then 
        the calculation would be 5*4*3*2*1 as you can see this is like n*(n-1)*(n-2)*(n-3)*(n-4). Does your code 
        do n*factorial(n-1) as in the example above?

        Hello, thank you so much for the insight. I was able to figure out what was wrong with my code. I was doing 
        my recursion wrong. Before I had n*calculateFactorial(n-2) instead of n*calculateFactorial(n-1). Thank you so much!

        Here's a snippet of my correct code:

<h2>A description of what to edit to fix the bug</h2>
<p>The fault is in the recursive call within the calculateFactorial method in the submitted Java code. To correctly calculate the factorial, instead of removing 2 from n in the recursive call, subtract 1. The student updated the recursive call in the corrected version from calculateFactorial(n - 2) to calculateFactorial(n - 1). This modification ensures that the recursive calculation decrements n by one at each step, resulting in the accurate computation of the factorial.</p>
